# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Jahongir Hakimov

Programming is something I genuinely enjoy â€” especially building things, even if I don't always make them public. It's more than just a skill for me; it's a hobby I come back to often.

## ðŸš€ What I'm Doing Now

- Working on personal projects
- Seeking new opportunities
- Open to work.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- HTML & CSS  
- JavaScript 
- Vue.js
- Node.js (Express, CORS, JWT, bcrypt, Socket.IO and etc)
- MySQL

## ðŸ§ª Projects

I've built around 20 personal projects - from simple front-end apps to full-stack setups
Some of them are available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/utopiaLF).

## ðŸŽ¯ About Me

- Programming is more than a skill â€” it's a hobby I truly enjoy
