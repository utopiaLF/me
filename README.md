# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Jahongir Hakimov

Programming is something I genuinely enjoy â€” especially building things, even if I don't always make them public. It's more than just a skill for me; it's a hobby I come back to often.

## ðŸš€ What I'm Doing Now

- Working on personal projects
- Exploring Vue.js more deeply

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- HTML & CSS  
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)  
- Vue.js (currently learning more advanced parts)  
- Basic Node.js  
- MySQL  

## ðŸ§ª Projects

I've built around 10 small personal projects - from simple front-end apps to basic full-stack setups.
Some of them are available on my [GitHub](https://utopialf.github.io).

## ðŸŽ¯ About Me

- Programming is more than a skill â€” it's a hobby I truly enjoy
- I like building things even just for myself
- I'm always curious and trying to learn something new
